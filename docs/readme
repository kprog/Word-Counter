Word-Counter has four components: data structures avl_tree and int_counts, main wordcount and parser. Each component 
is individually commented in the header file to help understanding the program.

The program is used to read a text file and count each words incidence. The program also counts the amount of sentences 
and their lengths. If the user runs the program with command line parameters the reading will be done from a file: the 
user can decide whether or not to have the output in a file or stdout. If no command line parameters are used, the reading 
will be done from stdin, and the output will be done using stdout.

Words will be stored in the AVL tree, while sentences will be stored in the int_counts list. 

The sentences must end in . ? ! to be counted as sentences.

How to use the program:

First the code has to be compiled. To do this, follow the steps:
1. Go to the projects folder, ie. ../NetBeansProjects/Word-Counter
2. Type make
and the code is compiled. 

To run the program using stdin:
1. Make sure the code is compiled.
2. Type ./wordounct
3. Type text.
4. To stop typing, hit ctrl+d.

To run the program using command line parameters:	
1. Make sure the code is compiled.
2. Make sure the file is in the projects folder.
2. Type ./wordcount filename
3. If you want the results to be written in a file, write this instead: ./wordcount inputfilename outputfilename
